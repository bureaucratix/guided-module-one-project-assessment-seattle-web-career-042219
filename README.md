# Welcome to CQL (City – Quality of Life!)


CQL is a Ruby-based CLI program that allows users to search and browse a variety of quality of life (QOL) metrics on different cities.

Do you want to move to a new city? Are you curious about you how your current city measures up? CQL is here to help you decide which city you should call home.

## Navigating the Program
CQL prompts you to enter a username to begin the application:
* if you are a new user, enter a new username
* if you are a returning user, enter your username

Once you are signed in, you will have a few options to choose from the main menu.

Enter the option you wish by typing in the key word (i.e "find", "list", "preferences").

You can also enter "exit" to quit the program!

### navigating find

Users can enter a city name to search QOL metric values (a numerical score out of 10). Once you enter a city name, the program outputs a list of cities with similar matches so you can select the one you intended!

 ** Please note that the program limits return choices to 25 cities. Type the full name of the city to help the search function 👍🏻

Quality of life metrics data are available for major urban areas. If users select a suburb city, they receive the quality of life metrics for the greater urban area that the suburb belongs to as displayed below.

* 2 = Slightly important
* 3 = Somewhat important
